        <p>
            In the Philippines, the Bayanihan spirit is one of communal unity, being selfless towards others, to achieve a certain goal. Bayanihan happens when Filipinos unite to do heroic acts for individuals and communities in need without expecting anything in return. Giving aid to anyone, including strangers, is Filipino culture. In times of need, when everyone is a victim, Filipinos pitch in and give whatever they can. Magbayanihan tayo is a Filipino phrase used when someone invites other to become heroes for the community. In this case, a hero is someone who loves his people.
            <br/>
            The most popular demonstration of bayanihan is lipat-bahay. This is where memebers of the community help a family relocate their nipa hut. This is the shown in the image on the right.

        <p>
            Christmas is a special tradition in the Philippines. In the Philippines, Christmas lasts multiple months, lasting the duration of the months from September to January. These are called the "Ber" months. Families typically gather together to celebrate on December 25, but the holiday season starts earlier with lighting up neighborhoods and malls around November. Christmas Carols are played in shopping centers and people buy new clothes and shoes to wear in church or parties. "Noche Buena", or Christams Eve, is when most families eat their biggest meal of the year. After dinner they open presents. Some Filipino families also observe Simbang Gabi, a series of nine dawn masses on the days leading up to Christmas - beginning on December 16 and ends at midnight on December 24, when a midnight mass is held.

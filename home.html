        The first inhabitants of the Philippines were hunter-gatherers who migrated from Taiwan about 30,000 years ago. The first recoreded visit by a European was by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. He claimed the islands for Spain and named them Islas de las Filipinas after Philip II of Spain. The country was colonized by Spain in the 16th century, and remained a Spanish colony until 1898. It was ceded to the United States following the Spanish-American War. In 1935, the Philippines became a self-governing commonwealth. In 1942, Japan occupied the Philippines during World War II. After World War II, following Japan's defeat in 1945, independence was restored to the Phillippines and the country has been a republic since 1946.
